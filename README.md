# Keyboard again
I am making a new split keyboard! Based on the [last one I made](github.com/asmund20/keyboard_journey).

## This is a work in progress, do not assume that it works

Unfortunately, I could not include the footprint for the reset button, referenced as _SW_B3U-1000P_ in the ergogen config due to the licensing of the footprint I used. I was able to download a KiCad footprint for the part and used [Thunderbird2086/ergogen-footprint-generator](https://github.com/Thunderbird2086/ergogen-footprint-generator) to easily generate it, which you can do yourself if you want.
